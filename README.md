The article talks a lot about the importance of having good code organization strategies since the organization does not matter to the actual compiler, but is vital for any developer working with it. New developers and people approaching a project need to be able to understand the structure of the code so that they can also work on it. The article brings up a quote that says exactly that.

This article focuses on the actual file structure of a code repository, which I think is super interesting because originally when I would think of code organization, I would think of the individual files themselves. It brings up four different ways that one could organize their files into packages. He brings up the idea that any co-dependent code files or classes should be grouped together. Reading this article made me think more about how I organize my code.  

## Another Student's Comment on the Article

*I like how the article highlight the need for organization is not for computers but for mainly people. I thought Strategy #3 - organizing by layer - is the most relevant to our current learning on git repositories in which codes and files can be organized in "layers" that fit areas of contributor responsibility.*
